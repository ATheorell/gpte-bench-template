# GPT-Engineer Benchmark Suite Template

This repository serves as a template for creating an agent that interacts with the GPT-Engineer benchmark suite. Follow the instructions below to set up your project.

## Agent Implementation

Edit the benchmarking_agent.py file to implement your custom agent. This file contains a minimal example agent that you should replace with your own logic. Feel free to add any necessary functionality specific to your use case.

## Running the Benchmark

Execute the following command to install your project and run the agent against the benchmark suite:
```
./run.sh
```
run.sh also serves as a reference for how the template project is installed and run.
Remember that any api keys required by the implemented agents must be defined. The agent in the template requires OPENAI_API_KEY
